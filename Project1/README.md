# Codon-usage based gene finder 


### To-do:

1) Collect 1,000 *E. coli* genes

2) Compute the codon usage

3) Build a probabilistic model 

- Is relative entropy an acceptable measurement?

- Or do we take the log-likelihood? They both seem similar

4) Compare PMF of prior distribution to PMF of each of the six reading frames, choosing correct one.

5) Output ORFs from input sequence with likelihood
